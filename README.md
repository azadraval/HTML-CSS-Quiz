# Accessibility Quiz Project

This is my accessibility quiz project, created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. I built an interactive quiz form that demonstrates web accessibility best practices and proper form structure.

## Project Overview

The Accessibility Quiz project helped me learn how to create web content that is accessible to all users, including those who rely on assistive technologies. The quiz includes sections about HTML and CSS, with various question types structured in an accessible manner.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:
- Implementing proper semantic HTML for better accessibility
- Using ARIA attributes to enhance screen reader compatibility
- Creating accessible forms with proper labeling
- Structuring content with appropriate heading hierarchy
- Adding screen reader-only text for additional context
- Implementing proper navigation with skip links
- Creating a logical tab order for keyboard navigation
- Using appropriate form controls with proper associations

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The HTML structure with the quiz form and accessibility features
- `styles.css` - The CSS file that styles the quiz while maintaining accessibility

## Design Elements

The quiz features:
- A clear header with navigation
- Organized sections for different parts of the quiz
- Various question types (radio buttons, select dropdown, textarea)
- Student information collection with appropriate input types
- Proper form submission controls
- Responsive layout that works on different devices
- Visual indicators for interactive elements
- Consistent styling for better user experience

This project was particularly meaningful as it taught me that good web design isn't just about how something looks, but also about how it can be used by everyone. I've gained a deeper appreciation for accessibility concerns and how to address them in my coding practices.
